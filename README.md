I have never done web development before, so don't make too much fun of me. 
* Creating a merge issue

## What did I learn?
I need to spend more time with GitHub. I am familiar with it, but I think that as I make commits more often
I will be quicker at using it. It took me a while to figure out how to resolve the merge issue (that's why we
have stack overflow). I am going to start using it for more than just the coding I do in this class, but also
for my other classes that I am in right now. 

## Startup
For my startup application I want to create an app that merges learningsuite with canvas. These are both great learning tools, but I have always been annoyed with having to use both. I wish we could use one or the other. So that is where I got my idea to create my own learning dashboard that merges the two using canvas' API, and for BYU's I guess copy and paste of the prioritzer list will have to due. Unless learning suite has an API I can use. It will have account creation, the basic CRUD functions(CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE), API integration, database storage, and a mobile version. 

## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever been annoyed with having to use learningsuite alongside with canvas? You just want all of your
courses to be in one spot? Look no further, with ScheduleBuilder you can easily combine your coursework materials from learningsuite with those from canvas in one easy to use application!
