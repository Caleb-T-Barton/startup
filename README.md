I have never done web development before, so don't make too much fun of me. 
* Creating a merge issue

## What did I learn?
I need to spend more time with GitHub. I am familiar with it, but I think that as I make commits more often
I will be quicker at using it. It took me a while to figure out how to resolve the merge issue (that's why we
have stack overflow). I am going to start using it for more than just the coding I do in this class, but also
for my other classes that I am in right now.
